## Quiz API
- Avoid Inline Styles: Instead of using inline styles, it's generally better to use external CSS files or define styles in a <style> section. This makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.

- Avoid Repetition: There is a lot of repetition in your JavaScript functions for setting up questions and handling answer clicks. This can be improved using loops and functions.

- Separation of Concerns: Try to separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into their respective sections. This makes the code more readable and easier to debug.

- Use Event Listeners: Instead of using onclick attributes in each HTML element, you can set up event listeners in your JavaScript code. This separates the behavior from the structure.

- Dynamic Generation of HTML: Rather than hardcoding each question and answer, consider dynamically generating them based on the data received from the API.

- Error Handling: Add error handling for cases where the API request fails.

## Stocks API

### Potential Improvements:

- It's good practice to put API keys in environment variables or use a more secure method for handling sensitive information, rather than having it directly in the code.
- It might be helpful to add some error handling for cases where the user doesn't provide a stock symbol or if the API call fails for any reason.
Additional Suggestions:
- Consider providing some feedback to the user after they click the "Get Intraday Data" button, to indicate that the data is being loaded.
You might want to consider adding labels, legends, and additional options to enhance the chart's usability.
