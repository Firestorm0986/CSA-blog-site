## Tools

### Vscode

I love vscode b/c I like the quick integration of any language, the amazing UI and the plethora of extensions. My fav extension is Blackbox which is an AI helper that helps write, debug and create files like readme.

### Ubuntu

I like ubuntu because of it's flexibility and large number of packages that are part of it.

### Slack

I love slack because it allows for easy and quick communication. Additionally, it is one of the only communication services that is not blacked by the school wifi

### Github Pages

I like github pages because of it's easy integration and usage It also has many themes that help satisfy creativity that comes. It is also the easiest way to deploy or host a site that I have used.
